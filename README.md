## How it's made
Dpots is made using Next.js and Solidity smart contracts which is deployed on polygon testnet. In the frontend it uses Moralis to interact with the smart contract and perform authentication. This was my first time making the whole project myself and moralis really made my work easier and fast once i got the hang of it.
